# Overview of Unit Tests for Palmera Module

This suite of unit tests is designed to validate the core functionality, security, 
and interoperability of the Palmera Module in various scenarios. Each test case 
focuses on a specific aspect of the module, ensuring that the deployment, configuration,
and execution processes work as expected.

## Key Aspects Covered:

1. **Deployment and Configuration**:
    - Ensuring that Safe accounts are deployed with the Palmera Module and Guard enabled.
    - Verifying the proper setup of organizational structures within the Palmera Module.

2. **Execution of Transactions**:
    - Testing the `execTransactionOnBehalf` function with different callers, including 
    Externally Owned Accounts (EOA) and other Safe accounts.
    - Handling and verifying multiple simultaneous transactions using arrays of promises 
    and batch transactions.

3. **Organizational Structures**:
    - Creating and validating linear and 1-to-3 tree organizational structures.
    - Promoting Safe accounts within the organization and testing their new roles and 
    permissions.

4. **Complex Transaction Scenarios**:
    - Executing complex batch transactions that include various types of operations, 
    such as adding and removing owners, setting roles, updating depth tree limits, and 
    disconnecting Safe accounts.
    - Ensuring that each individual transaction within a batch is executed correctly 
    and securely.

## Summary of Test Cases:

### Basic Linear Organization Tests:
- **Create and Execute Transactions with EOA**: Validates the creation of a basic 
linear org and the execution of transactions on behalf of the root Safe by an EOA.
- **Create and Execute Transactions with Another Safe**: Ensures the correct execution 
of transactions on behalf of the root Safe by another Safe account.

### 1-to-3 Organization Tests:
- **Create and Execute Transactions with EOA**: Tests the creation of a 1-to-3 
organizational structure and the execution of transactions by an EOA.
- **Create and Execute Transactions with Another Safe**: Validates transactions 
executed by another Safe account within a 1-to-3 organizational structure.

### Large Scale and Complex Transaction Tests:
- **Create 20 Linear Orgs and Execute Arrays of Promises**: Ensures the Palmera Module 
can handle multiple orgs and simultaneous transactions.
- **Promote Safe Accounts and Execute Transactions**: Tests the promotion of Safe 
accounts and their ability to execute transactions on behalf of other accounts.
- **Execute Batch Transactions**: Validates the execution of a batch of transactions, 
ensuring that all operations within the batch are performed correctly.

These tests collectively ensure that the Palmera Module operates correctly in various 
complex scenarios, maintaining security and correctness across all functionalities.
