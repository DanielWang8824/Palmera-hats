# Summary of `SignDigestHelper.sol`

## Overview

This helper contract contains two main functionalities:

1. Signing a transaction digest with multiple private keys.
2. Sorting an array of addresses.

These functionalities are essential for testing scenarios where multiple signatures are required, such as multi-signature wallets or any contract that requires multiple signatories. Sorting addresses can be useful for maintaining a canonical order of addresses for comparison or other operations.

## Key Components

- **`signDigestTx` Function:**
  - Takes an array of private keys and a digest to be signed.
  - Returns the concatenated signatures of all private keys on the given digest.

- **`sortAddresses` Function:**
  - Takes an array of addresses.
  - Returns the array sorted in ascending order.

# Breakdown of Key Functions

## `signDigestTx`

This function is used to sign a given digest with multiple private keys. It returns the concatenated signatures, which can be used to authenticate a multi-signature transaction.

```solidity
function signDigestTx(uint256[] memory _privateKeyOwners, bytes32 digest)
    public
    pure
    returns (bytes memory)
{
    bytes memory signatures;
    for (uint256 i; i < _privateKeyOwners.length;) {
        (uint8 v, bytes32 r, bytes32 s) = vm.sign(_privateKeyOwners[i], digest);
        signatures = abi.encodePacked(signatures, r, s, v);
        unchecked {
            ++i;
        }
    }

    return signatures;
}
```

- **Parameters:**
  - `_privateKeyOwners`: An array of private keys that will be used to sign the digest.
  - `digest`: The message digest to be signed.

- **Returns:**
  - `signatures`: A byte array containing the concatenated signatures of all private keys on the given digest.

- **Implementation Details:**
  - Iterates over the array of private keys.
  - Signs the digest using each private key.
  - Packs the resulting `(r, s, v)` values into a byte array.

## `sortAddresses`

This function sorts an array of addresses in ascending order. It uses a simple sorting algorithm.

```solidity
function sortAddresses(address[] memory addresses)
    public
    pure
    returns (address[] memory)
{
    for (uint256 i = addresses.length - 1; i > 0;) {
        for (uint256 j; j < i;) {
            if (addresses[i] < addresses[j]) {
                (addresses[i], addresses[j]) = (addresses[j], addresses[i]);
            }
            unchecked {
                ++j;
            }
        }
        unchecked {
            --i;
        }
    }

    return addresses;
}
```

- **Parameters:**
  - `addresses`: An array of addresses to be sorted.

- **Returns:**
  - A sorted array of addresses.

- **Implementation Details:**
  - Uses a nested loop to compare and swap elements if they are out of order.
  - Continues until the array is sorted in ascending order.

# Example Usage in Tests

This helper contract is useful in unit tests for smart contracts that require multiple signatures for transactions. For example, in a test for a multi-signature wallet, you can use `signDigestTx` to generate the necessary signatures from the owners' private keys. Similarly, you can use `sortAddresses` to ensure that address arrays are sorted consistently when comparing results or preparing inputs for other contract functions.

# Conclusion

The `SignDigestHelper.sol` contract provides essential utilities for signing transaction digests with multiple private keys and sorting arrays of addresses. These functionalities are crucial for testing multi-signature wallets and other smart contracts that involve multiple signatories. By automating the signing process and ensuring consistent order of addresses, this helper contract simplifies the setup and verification of complex test scenarios.
