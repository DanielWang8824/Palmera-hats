# Summary of `SignersHelper.sol`

## Overview

The `SignersHelper` contract extends the `Test` contract from Foundry, which provides utilities for testing smart contracts. The main purpose of this helper contract is to initialize and manage a set of valid and invalid signer addresses, along with their associated private keys. This is particularly useful in scenarios where multiple signers are needed, such as in multi-signature wallets or DAOs.

## Key Components

- **State Variables:**
  - `uint256[] public privateKeyOwners`: Array to store private keys of valid owners.
  - `mapping(address => uint256) public ownersPK`: Mapping from owner addresses to their private keys.
  - `uint256[] public invalidPrivateKeyOwners`: Array to store private keys of invalid owners.
  - `mapping(address => uint256) public invalidOwnersPK`: Mapping from invalid owner addresses to their private keys.
  - `uint256 public countUsed`: Counter to keep track of the number of owners used.

## Functions

1. **`initOnwers(uint256 numberOwners)`:**
   - Initializes both valid and invalid owners.
   - Calls `initValidOnwers` and `initInvalidOnwers` to set up the specified number of valid and a default number (30) of invalid owners.

   ```solidity
   function initOnwers(uint256 numberOwners) public
   ```

2. **`initValidOnwers(uint256 numberOwners)`:**
   - Internal function to initialize the specified number of valid owners.
   - Each owner is assigned a unique private key and the corresponding address is derived.

   ```solidity
   function initValidOnwers(uint256 numberOwners) internal
   ```

3. **`initInvalidOnwers(uint256 numberOwners)`:**
   - Internal function to initialize a specified number of invalid owners.
   - Invalid owners are derived starting from an offset to avoid conflicts with valid owners.

   ```solidity
   function initInvalidOnwers(uint256 numberOwners) internal
   ```

4. **`getOwnersUsed()`:**
   - Returns the number of owners that have been used so far.

   ```solidity
   function getOwnersUsed() public view returns (uint256)
   ```

5. **`updateCount(uint256 used)`:**
   - Updates the counter for the number of owners used.

   ```solidity
   function updateCount(uint256 used) public
   ```

### Breakdown of Key Functions

## `initOnwers`

This function is a public function that initializes both valid and invalid owners by calling the internal functions `initValidOnwers` and `initInvalidOnwers`.

```solidity
function initOnwers(uint256 numberOwners) public {
    initValidOnwers(numberOwners);
    initInvalidOnwers(30);
}
```

## `initValidOnwers`

This internal function initializes the specified number of valid owners. It creates a new array of private keys, assigns unique keys to each owner, and maps each address to its corresponding private key.

```solidity
function initValidOnwers(uint256 numberOwners) internal {
    privateKeyOwners = new uint256[](numberOwners);
    for (uint256 i; i < numberOwners;) {
        uint256 pk = i;
        // Avoid deriving public key from 0x address
        if (i == 0) {
            pk = 0xaaa;
        }
        address publicKey = vm.addr(pk);
        ownersPK[publicKey] = pk;
        privateKeyOwners[i] = pk;
        unchecked {
            ++i;
        }
    }
}
```

## `initInvalidOnwers`

This internal function initializes a specified number of invalid owners. It ensures that the private keys for invalid owners do not overlap with those of valid owners by starting the derivation from an offset.

```solidity
function initInvalidOnwers(uint256 numberOwners) internal {
    invalidPrivateKeyOwners = new uint256[](numberOwners);
    for (uint256 i; i < numberOwners;) {
        // Start derivation after correct ones
        uint256 pk = i + numberOwners;
        address publicKey = vm.addr(pk);
        invalidOwnersPK[publicKey] = pk;
        invalidPrivateKeyOwners[i] = pk;
        unchecked {
            ++i;
        }
    }
}
```

### Example Usage in Tests

This helper contract is particularly useful in unit tests for contracts that require multiple signers. For example, it can be used to initialize a multi-signature wallet with a specified number of signers, both valid and invalid, to test different scenarios involving authorization and transaction approval.

### Conclusion

The `SignersHelper.sol` contract is a utility for initializing and managing signer addresses and private keys in a testing environment. It automates the creation of both valid and invalid signers, making it easier to set up complex testing scenarios that involve multiple signers. This contract is essential for ensuring the thorough testing of multi-signature wallets, DAOs, and other smart contracts that rely on multiple signers for their operations.
