## Project Overview

The Palmera Module is an orchestration framework for On-Chain Organizations based on the Safe ecosystem, enabling the creation and management of hierarchies and permissions within On-Chain Organizations. It extends the capabilities of Safeâ€™s multisig wallet to manage assets and treasury in a secure and hierarchical manner. More Details in [Palmera Module Docs](https://docs.palmeradao.xyz/palmera).

## Functional Requirements

### 1.1. Enable Module and Guard

if you wanna to see in details the process to Enable Module and Set Guard, follow the docs and diagrams in:

- To Enable Module: [Safe Modules](https://docs.safe.global/advanced/smart-account-modules)
- Set Guard: [Safe Guard](https://docs.safe.global/advanced/smart-account-guards)

### 1.2. Roles and Authorizations

In this point we see the initial setup between Palmera Roles and Palmera Module, for Setup the Roles using the Solmete Auth / Roles Library, and the next steps to Deploy all Palmera Module and Guard.

    actor D as Deployer
    participant C as CREATE3 Factory (Deployed)
    participant R as Palmera Roles
    participant M as Palmera Module
    participant G as Palmera Guard

    D->>+C: Request the Next Address to Deploy with Salt Random
    C-->>D: Get Palmera Module Address Predicted
    D->>+R: Deploy Palmera Roles with
    opt Setup of Roles and Authorizations
        R->>+M: Setup Palmera Module like Admin of Roles
        Note over R, M: Setup Roles and Authorizations for Palmera Module <br> like are defined into Palmera Roles, where the Admin <br> is the Palmera Module and the unique can change <br> the Roles and Authorizations
    end

```

### 1.3. Features

- **Hierarchical Management**: Palmera Module allows the creation of hierarchical structures within the organization, enabling the creation of sub-organizations and the management of permissions and assets in a hierarchical manner.

- **Permission Management**: Palmera Module allows the management of permissions within the organization, enabling the creation of roles and authorizations for each role.

- **Asset Management**: Palmera Module allows the management of assets within the organization, enabling the creation of treasury and the management of assets in a secure manner.

- **Governance Management**: Palmera Module allows the management of governance within the organization, enabling the creation of voting mechanisms and the management of proposals in a secure manner.
