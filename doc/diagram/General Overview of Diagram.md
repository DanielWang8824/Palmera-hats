## Project Overview

The Palmera Module is an orchestration framework for On-Chain Organizations based on the Safe ecosystem, enabling the creation and management of hierarchies and permissions within On-Chain Organizations. It extends the capabilities of Safeâ€™s multisig wallet to manage assets and treasury in a secure and hierarchical manner. More Details in [Palmera Module Docs](https://docs.palmeradao.xyz/palmera).

## Functional Requirements

### 1.1. Enable Module and Guard

if you wanna to see in details the process to Enable Module and Set Guard, follow the docs and diagrams in:

- To Enable Module: [Safe Modules](https://docs.safe.global/advanced/smart-account-modules)
- Set Guard: [Safe Guard](https://docs.safe.global/advanced/smart-account-guards)

### 1.2. Roles and Authorizations

In this point we see the initial setup between Palmera Roles and Palmera Module, for Setup the Roles using the Solmete Auth / Roles Library
