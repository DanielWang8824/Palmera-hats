# Summary of `TestDeploy` Contract

## Overview

The `TestDeploy` contract is a test suite designed to validate the deployment of multiple libraries within a mock Gnosis Safe environment. This test suite extends the Forge Standard Library's `Test` contract and incorporates helper functions from the `DeployHelper` contract. The purpose of this contract is to ensure that the libraries can be deployed successfully and that the deployment script runs as expected.

## Unit Tests

### Setup Function

- **Function**: `setUp`
- **Purpose**: Initialize the testing environment by deploying the `DeployModuleWithMockedSafe` contract.
- **Details**:
  - Create an instance of `DeployModuleWithMockedSafe` and assign it to the `deploy` variable.

### Test Library Deployment

- **Function**: `testDeploy`
- **Purpose**: Verify that the libraries can be deployed successfully and that the deployment script runs without issues.
- **Steps**:
  - Call the `deployLibraries` function to deploy the following libraries:
    - `Constants`
    - `DataTypes`
    - `Errors`
    - `Events`
  - Log the addresses of the deployed libraries to the console.
    - Output the address of `Constants` library.
    - Output the address of `DataTypes` library.
    - Output the address of `Errors` library.
    - Output the address of `Events` library.
  - Execute the `run` function of the `DeployModuleWithMockedSafe` contract to complete the deployment process.

## Conclusions

The `TestDeploy` contract provides essential tests for validating the deployment of libraries within a mock Gnosis Safe environment. These tests ensure that the libraries can be deployed and that the deployment script executes correctly. By verifying these steps, the contract provides a robust framework for managing library deployments in a decentralized environment.
