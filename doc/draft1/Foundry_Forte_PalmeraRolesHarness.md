# Technical Overview of Foundry/Forte Unit Tests for Palmera Module

## PalmeraRolesHarness.t.sol

The `PalmeraRolesHarness` contract tests the internal methods of the Palmera Roles contract.

## Overview

The unit tests in the `PalmeraRolesHarness` contract are designed to ensure the correct functionality of the internal methods in the Palmera Roles contract. These tests are structured using Foundry's testing framework.

## Setup Method

### `setUp()`

The `setUp` method prepares the testing environment before each test case is executed.

#### Actions

- **Deploy PalmeraRolesHarness**: Deploys the `PalmeraRolesHarness` contract to expose internal methods for testing.
- **Set Palmera Module Address**: Sets the Palmera Module address to `0xAAAA`.

## Detailed Explanation of Each Test Case

### Test Case 1: `testSetupRolesCapabilities`

#### Description

This test verifies that the `setupRoles` function correctly assigns capabilities to various roles within the Palmera Roles contract.

#### Steps

1. **Start Prank**: Begins a prank to impersonate the Palmera Module.
2. **Call `setupRoles`**: Calls the `exposed_setupRoles` function to set up roles and their capabilities.
3. **Stop Prank**: Ends the prank.
4. **Check SAFE_LEAD Capabilities**: Verifies that the `SAFE_LEAD` role has the `ADD_OWNER`, `REMOVE_OWNER`, and `EXEC_ON_BEHALF` capabilities.
5. **Check SAFE_LEAD_EXEC_ON_BEHALF_ONLY Capabilities**: Verifies that the `SAFE_LEAD_EXEC_ON_BEHALF_ONLY` role has the `EXEC_ON_BEHALF` capability.

### Conclusion

The `PalmeraRolesHarness` tests are crucial for ensuring the internal methods of the Palmera Roles contract function correctly. By exposing and testing these methods, the tests validate the correct assignment of capabilities to roles, ensuring the robustness and security of the role management system.
