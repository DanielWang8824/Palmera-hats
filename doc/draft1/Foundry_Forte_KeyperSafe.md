# Technical Overview of Foundry/Forte Unit Tests for Palmera Module

## KeyperSafe.t.sol

The `KeyperSafe` contract tests various functionalities of the Palmera Safe, including authority checks and allow/deny list operations.

## Overview

The unit tests in the `KeyperSafe` contract are designed to ensure the correct functionality of the Palmera Safe, focusing on authority verification and allow/deny list features. These tests are structured using Foundry's testing framework.

## Setup Method

### `setUp()`

The `setUp` method prepares the testing environment before each test case is executed.

#### Actions

- **Deploy All Contracts**: Uses the `DeployHelper` to deploy all necessary contracts with a predefined parameter of 90.

## Detailed Explanation of Each Test Case

### Test Case 1: `testAuthorityAddress`

#### Description

This test verifies that the authority address is correctly set to the Palmera Roles contract.

#### Steps

1. **Check Authority Address**: Verifies that the authority address of the Palmera Module is set to the Palmera Roles contract.
2. **Assertions**:
   - Ensures the authority address matches the expected Palmera Roles contract address.

### Test Case 2: `testRevertSuperSafeExecOnBehalfIsNotAllowList`

#### Description

This test verifies that a transaction is reverted if the Safe is not on the allow list.

#### Steps

1. **Setup Organization and Safes**: Initializes an organization and sets up Safes (`safeA1` and `subSafeA1`).
2. **Send ETH to Safes**: Sends ETH to `safeA1` and `subSafeA1`.
3. **Enable Allowlist**: Enables the allow list for the root Safe.
4. **Set Palmera Helper Safe**: Sets the Palmera Helper to `safeA1`.
5. **Attempt Transaction**: Attempts to execute a transaction on behalf of `safeA1` to `subSafeA1`.
6. **Assertions**:
   - Ensures the transaction is reverted because `safeA1` is not on the allow list.

### Conclusion

The `KeyperSafe` contract ensures that the authority checks and allow/deny list functionalities of the Palmera Safe are functioning correctly. By testing these scenarios, the robustness and security of the Palmera Safe are validated.
