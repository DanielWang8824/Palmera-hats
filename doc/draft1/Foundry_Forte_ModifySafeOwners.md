# Technical Overview of Foundry/Forte Unit Tests for Palmera Module

## ModifySafeOwners.t.sol

The `ModifySafeOwners` contract tests the functionality of modifying Safe account owners within the Palmera Module.

## Overview

The unit tests in the `ModifySafeOwners` contract are designed to ensure the correct functionality of adding and removing Safe owners. These tests are structured using Foundry's testing framework.

## Setup Method

### `setUp()`

The `setUp` method prepares the testing environment before each test case is executed.

#### Actions

- **Deploy All Contracts**: Uses the `DeployHelper` to deploy all necessary contracts with a predefined parameter of 90.

## Detailed Explanation of Each Test Case

### Test Case 1: `testCan_AddOwnerWithThreshold_SAFE_LEAD_MODIFY_OWNERS_ONLY_as_EOA_is_TARGETS_LEAD`

#### Description

This test verifies that a user with the `SAFE_LEAD_MODIFY_OWNERS_ONLY` role can add an owner to a Safe with a modified threshold.

#### Steps

1. **Setup Root Organization and One Safe**: Initializes a root organization and a Safe (`safeIdA1`).
2. **Assign Role**: Assigns the `SAFE_LEAD_MODIFY_OWNERS_ONLY` role to an EOA (`userLeadModifyOwnersOnly`).
3. **Update Safe Interface**: Updates the Safe interface for `safeA1Addr`.
4. **Add Owner with Threshold**: Adds a new owner to the Safe with an incremented threshold.
5. **Assertions**:
   - Ensures the threshold is incremented correctly.
   - Verifies that the new owner is added to the Safe.

### Test Case 2: `testCan_AddOwnerWithThreshold_SAFE_LEAD_as_SAFE_is_TARGETS_LEAD`

#### Description

This test verifies that a Safe with the `SAFE_LEAD` role can add an owner to another Safe with a modified threshold.

#### Steps

1. **Setup Root Organization and Two Safes**: Initializes a root organization and two Safes (`safeIdA1` and `safeIdB`).
2. **Assign Role**: Assigns the `SAFE_LEAD` role to a Safe (`safeBAddr`).
3. **Update Safe Interface**: Updates the Safe interface for `safeA1Addr`.
4. **Add Owner with Threshold**: Adds a new owner to the Safe with an incremented threshold.
5. **Assertions**:
   - Ensures the threshold is incremented correctly.
   - Verifies that the new owner is added to the Safe.

### Test Case 3: `testCan_AddOwnerWithThreshold_SAFE_LEAD_as_EOA_is_TARGETS_LEAD`

#### Description

This test verifies that a user with the `SAFE_LEAD` role can add an owner to a Safe with a modified threshold.

#### Steps

1. **Setup Root Organization and One Safe**: Initializes a root organization and a Safe (`safeIdA1`).
2. **Assign Role**: Assigns the `SAFE_LEAD` role to an EOA (`userLead`).
3. **Update Safe Interface**: Updates the Safe interface for `safeA1Addr`.
4. **Add Owner with Threshold**: Adds a new owner to the Safe with an incremented threshold.
5. **Assertions**:
   - Ensures the threshold is incremented correctly.
   - Verifies that the new owner is added to the Safe.

### Conclusion

The `ModifySafeOwners` contract ensures that the functionality for modifying Safe owners within the Palmera Module is robust and secure. By testing various scenarios for adding owners with modified thresholds, these tests validate the correctness and security of the owner modification process.
