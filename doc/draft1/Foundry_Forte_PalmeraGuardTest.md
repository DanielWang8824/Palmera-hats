# Technical Overview of Foundry/Forte Unit Tests for Palmera Module

## PalmeraGuardTest.t.sol

The `PalmeraGuardTest` contract tests the functionality of the Palmera Guard contract, including enabling and disabling guards and modules.

## Overview

The unit tests in the `PalmeraGuardTest` contract are designed to ensure the correct functionality of the Palmera Guard contract. These tests are structured using Foundry's testing framework.

## Setup Method

### `setUp()`

The `setUp` method prepares the testing environment before each test case is executed.

#### Actions

- **Deploy All Contracts**: Uses the `DeployHelper` to deploy all necessary contracts with a predefined parameter of 90.

## Detailed Explanation of Each Test Case

### Test Case 1: `testDisablePalmeraGuard`

#### Description

This test verifies that the Palmera Guard can be correctly disabled.

#### Steps

1. **Disable Guard**: Attempts to disable the Palmera Guard using the `disableGuardTx` function.
2. **Assertions**: 
   - Ensures the guard is disabled by checking the result of the transaction.
   - Verifies that the guard has been disabled by checking the storage slot associated with the guard.

### Test Case 2: `testDisablePalmeraModule`

#### Description

This test verifies that the Palmera Module can be correctly disabled.

#### Steps

1. **Check Module Enabled**: Checks if the Palmera Module is enabled initially.
2. **Disable Module**: Attempts to disable the Palmera Module using the `disableModuleTx` function.
3. **Assertions**: 
   - Ensures the module is disabled by checking the result of the transaction.
   - Verifies that the module has been disabled by checking if it is still enabled.

### Test Case 3: `testCannotReplayAttackRemoveSafe`

#### Description

This test verifies that replay attacks cannot be used to remove a Safe.

#### Steps

1. **Setup Root Organization and Safe**: Sets up a root organization and a Safe.
2. **Attempt Replay Attack**: Attempts to use a replay attack to remove the Safe.
3. **Assertions**: 
   - Ensures that the replay attack is not successful by checking the state of the Safe.

### Conclusion

The `PalmeraGuardTest` contract ensures that the guard and module functionalities of the Palmera Guard contract handle enabling and disabling correctly, as well as protecting against replay attacks. By testing these functionalities, the robustness and security of the Palmera Guard contract are validated.
